    <!-- Overview -->
    <p>
        The Art Hunt is a game that will test your ability to develop and execute strategy under conditions of uncertainty. 
        You will have to make trade-offs, work as a team to achieve your goals, and take varying motivations and capabilities into account. 
        This will involve drawing on a variety of skills and perspectives and continually testing assumptions and scenarios.
        <br><br>
        Every decision, including those of other teams, will influence the outcome of the game, meaning no single strategy will guarantee success. 
        You will need to plan, and then you will need to adapt.

        <div class="rule-expansion-text">
            <p>
                At its most basic, the Art Hunt sees teams competing against each other for points by visiting sites of artistic or 
                heritage value around the city and entering information about each one. You will have limited time, typically around 
                2.5 hours. Sites are widely distributed, with a maximum distance from home base of around 2 km, and are indicated on a map provided in the app.
            </p>
            <p>At each site youâ€™ll find a noteworthy artefact, which may include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Sculptures</li>
                <li>Statues</li>
                <li>Paintings and murals</li>
                <li>Architectural features</li>
                <li>Memorials</li>
                <li>Other noteworthy fixtures</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Your team must take a photo of itself with the art work/artefact featured clearly and prominently in the image. You will also have the 
                option to enter details about the site for additional points. Details are selected from a list of about 25 options and cover:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Theme</li>
                <li>Close-up image</li>
                <li>Artefact title or name</li>
                <li>Artist name</li>
                <li>Artefact year</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                The theme is an abstract concept related to the artefact. To determine the theme, you will need to consider the work 
                in its larger context, and draw clues from plaques, inscriptions, or online resources.
                <br><br>
                The close-up image is a macro photo taken from somewhere on the artefact, so you will need to pay close attention; 
                there is only one correct close-up image per site.
                <br><br>
                The title, artist name, and year have been determined by research. In some cases, these details are not available or 
                known; if you correctly identify unknown details, your team will earn the associated points for that detail.

    <!-- Expansion 2 - Team Points and Scoring -->
    <mat-expansion-panel class="rule-expansion">
        <mat-expansion-panel-header>
            <mat-panel-title>
                <h2 class="rule-expansion-title">Team Points and Scoring</h2>
            </mat-panel-title>
        </mat-expansion-panel-header>
        
        <div class="rule-expansion-text">
            <p>
                The app contains a list of sites and a map, both of which show the number of points your team will earn for successfully 
                submitting that site. The starting points are broken into the following categories:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Site: 25%</li>
                <li>Theme: 40%</li>
                <li>Close-up image: 20%</li>
                <li>Title: 5%</li>
                <li>Artist: 5%</li>
                <li>Year: 5%</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                These point proportions may change over the course of the game as teams visit sites and affect the points, but 
                they are a good guide when planning your strategy.
                <br><br>
                Except for the site points (taking a team photo at the correct site), all other details are optional and you may choose 
                not to submit them. You will earn the indicated points for correct answers, and lose the indicated value for incorrect 
                answers, and these points will go back onto the site.
                <br><br>
                Points are allocated for each detail according to the following:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Correct answer: site points >>> team points</li>
                <li>No answer submitted: no change in points for either team or site</li>
                <li>Incorrect answer: team points <<< site points</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Be aware that if you get the site wrong, you will almost certainly get all the other details wrong, and therefore lose all 
                other points associated with that site.
            </p>
            <h4>Proportional Points for Team Members</h4>
            <p>
                All team members must be present in the site photos to earn full points, and you will be penalised for team members missing from 
                the photo. The more team members, the more points you lose. And the rate of lose is not linear, it increases with each absent team member.
                <br><br>
                Proportional points do not apply for team members who are registered as virtual or office-based participants. These people are 
                not expected to be in the photos and you will not lose points for their absence.
            </p>
            <h4>Team Points Growth</h4>
            <p>
                Each team will earn a growth rate according to half the average growth rate of the sites it visits (details of site growth rates can be found in the Game Rounds and Site Points section). 
                Therefore, it's worthwhile targeting sites with higher growth rates to increase your team's points over time.
            </p>
            <h4>Revisiting Sites</h4>
            <p>
                It is not possible for a team to visit and submit the same site more than once, no matter how successful your previous submission.
            </p>
            <h4>Strategy Points and Ranking</h4>
            <p>
                Teams can earn points by selecting and adhering to specific strategies. This is done through the Strategies page in the app.
                <br><br>
                The strategies listed aren't strategies, per se, but represent approaches that are consistent with different types of strategies 
                and are measurable and can be ranked automatically within the game. For example, there is longest distance, most accurate, most sites, etc.
                <br><br>
                To earn points, your team must select a strategy and then achieve that strategy by being the highest ranking team according to 
                that measure for a given game round. Strategies are evaluated every round, so success or failure in one round does not impact 
                subsequent rounds. However, it's important to keep in mind that while strategies are evaluated every round, the items being ranked 
                are the totals for the entire game, not only what was achieve during that round. In other words, if your team has visited the most sites 
                throughout the game and is ranked 1 overall, you will achieve this strategy even if you visited no sites in the last round.
                <br><br>
                Your team will earn a 3% bonus on its total points for every round in which it has selcted and achieved the strategy. If you are top-ranked 
                on a measure but haven't selected it as a strategy, your team doesn't earn additional points. And if you have selected a strategy but failed 
                to achieve it, your team will lose 3% of its total points for that round. Although these may not seem like significant numbers, subject to 
                compounding they can have a large impact on your overall score.
                <br><br>
                Your team normally has no visibility of your team's rankings except whether or not you have achieved a strategy. However, virtual team members 
                will have visibility of your team's ranking across all measures.
                <br><br>
                You can select a strategy at any time by clicking on the 'Start' button next to the strategy. The table should indicate it has been selected, 
                and the button will change to 'Stop', which can be used to de-select the strategy. Only strategies that are selected at the conclusion of a game 
                round are evaluated, and there is no penalty for starting or stopping strategies at any time.
            </p>
            <h4>Transferring Points</h4>
            <p>
                Teams may transer points between each other, and may choose to do so for many valid reasons, such as in return for providing site 
                information, agreeing to not submit a site, etc. Use the Transfer Points page to access this functionality.

        <div class="rule-expansion-text">
            <p>
                Site points are not static and will change throughout the game. The changes include (details follow):
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Points change from team visits, as detailed in the Scoring section.</li>
                <li>Site growth rates.</li>
                <li>Site points regeneration.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Game Rounds</h4>
            <p>
                Several elements of the Art Hunt, such as points growth, are controlled by timers. Each time the main timer 
                ticks over, a game round is complete. You should see notifications in the app when this happens.
                <br><br>
                Typically, each round will last for around 3 to 5 minutes.
                <br><br>
                At the end of each game round, the following will occur:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Team points growth rates will be applied.</li>
                <li>Team strategies will be evaluated and strategy points allocated.</li>
                <li>If teams have transferred points in a previous round, they will be allowed to transfer points again.</li>
                <li>Team rankings will be updated.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                In addition to the main timer, a secondary timer controls site growth rates and points regeneration (details follow below).
            </p>
            <h4>Site Growth Rates</h4>
            <p>
                Each site has a growth rate, which typically starts at 1% to 5% per round of growth, but grows after that. 
                That is, the site's points grow, but so does it's growth rate. More distant and isolated works generally attract 
                a greater growth rate. The growth rate will continue to grow as long as:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>the site is not visited</li>
                <li>the growth rate has not reached it's maximum level (currently 6%)</li>
                <li>the site's total points have not reached the maximum level (currently 10,000)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                The map and site list will be updated to reflect the changes. If a site is visited, it's growth rate reverts to the original level and begins growing again.
                <br><br>
                Site growth points are not assigned for each game round, but according to the site regeneration timer as outlined in the following section.
            </p>
            <h4>Site Growth Rates Relationship to Team Growth Rate</h4>
            <p>
                As detailed in the Scoring section, team points also grow over time. Your team's points growth rate will be half the 
                rate of the average of the sites you successfully submit. For example, if your team submits sites with 2%, 3%, and 4% 
                growth rates, the average will be 3%. Therefore, your team points growth rate will be 1.5% per round, until you submit another site and change it.
            </p>

            <h4>Site Points Depletion and Regeneration</h4>
            <p>
                When the sites regenation timer ticks over and randomly selects sites for updating, there are two types of sites it can encounter:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    A visited site (or depleted site) - the points have changed since the last timer tick because a team has taken points from it, 
                    or sometimes left points on it for incorrect details. Points regeneration and growth rates will apply to this site.
                </li>
                <li>
                    An unvisited site - the points have not changed since the last timer tick. Only points growth rates will apply to this site.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                If another team visits a site immediately after a previous visit, the new team is unlikely to win many points (if the previous team was accurate). However, sites are re-allocated points over time, so it may be worth waiting a few minutes before visiting a site after another team.
                <br><br>
                In terms of the impact on strategy, points to keep in mind:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Don't visit a site immediately after another team, instead, give it time to regenerate (but be prepared to wait at least one game round or more).
                </li>
                <li>
                    If you are following a very accurate and thorough team, the generated site will have reverted to a relatively low score and may not be worthwhile.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If you are following an inaccurate team, a team that's not at all thorough, or visiting a difficult site that's had lots of errors, the visited site 
                    is likely to have a higher score compared to what it would have had without visits.
                </li>
                <li>
                    In all cases, a site's growth rate reverts back to it's lowest point after a visit. Early in the game, this has little impact, 
                    but later it means a site's growth will slow considerably.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Locked Sites</h4>
            <p>
                Once a team submits a site, it needs to be checked manually by the event administrator. This normally happens quickly, 
                but it's possible for there to be a delay of up to a few minutes before this occurs. During this time, the site is considered 
                locked and cannot be submitted by another team; if you try to do so, you will receive an error. Locked sites are usually shown 
                as such in your Sites page, but it's possible they won't be if the list hasn't fully synchronised.

        </mat-expansion-panel-header>
        
        <div class="rule-expansion-text">
            <h4>Locating Artefacts</h4>
            <p>
                Generally, most artefacts at sites should be easy to spot, as theyâ€™ll will be positioned in prominent places. However, 
                sometimes they arenâ€™t obvious, especially in the case of architectural features, so you should look up and all around, 
                and you may sometimes need to rely on research to locate them.
            </p>
            <h4>Map Markers</h4>
            <p>
                Map locations are subject to many variables and should be considered indicative only, meaning an artefact may be only approximately 
                within the location specified. However, it should always be within 25 metres or so of the point on the map.
            </p>
            <h4>Multiple Sites in Close Proximity</h4>
            <p>
                Often there are two or more sites in very close proximity and itâ€™s impossible to tell reliably from the map which is which. There 
                are two ways to differentiate such sites. First, all sites include a clue in the app when viewing the site details or submitting a 
                site. Second, you can use the list of site detail options, e.g. artist, year, and close-up image as a clue in identifying the correct site.
            </p>
            <h4>Artefacts Not Included in the Art Hunt</h4>
            <p>
                Although the Art Hunt includes most public art works and other artefacts around the city, not everything is included. Therefore, 
                be careful when submitting an item if you havenâ€™t clearly associated it with a map point, site clue, or other details, as you will 
                lose points for incorrect submissions and lose the opportunity to select the correct one in its place.
            </p>
            <h4>Difficult to Access Sites</h4>
            <p>
                Although in general your teamâ€™s site photo should feature an artefact as close as possible, usually within several metres, some sites 
                are difficult to access. For example, they may be at a height or next to a road. In these cases, take the photo from as close as 
                is completely safe and legal. At no time should you put anyone in danger by entering area not open to pedestrians, climbing, etc.
            </p>
            <h4>Missing Artefacts Sites</h4>
            <p>
                Sometimes artefacts remain in the app although they have been removed, temporarily covered or closed, or are otherwise inaccessible, 
                e.g. due to construction work. There are also several indoor sites that may be locked outside normal business hours.
                <br><br>
                While this should only apply to a very small number of sites, it means there are some you wonâ€™t be able to find. If you canâ€™t find a 
                site, donâ€™t waste too much time on it, and donâ€™t deviate too far from the map marker.
                <br><br>
                Additionally, it is absolutely forbidden to risk anyoneâ€™s safety or property, or to break laws and regulations during the Art Hunt. 
                For that reason, if a site cannot be easily and safely accessed, you should leave it. Any team deemed to have risked safety or property will be disqualified.

                Most players of this game will be out in the field answering questions from each site, some players wonâ€™t be able to join 
                in and will have to join as a virtual member. As a way to make the virtual member more engaged and important in the 
                game, they will get certain perks and advantages that no other team member has in order to help with whatever strategy 
                the team has implemented. These perks include:
